# Books_for_DeepLearning
E-books recommended by Udacity for a deep understanding of Deep Laerning:\
1. <b>Grokking Deep Learning by Andrew Trask.</b> This book provides a very gentle introduction to Deep Learning and covers the intuition more than the theory.<br>
2. <b>Neural Networks And Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen.</b> This book is more rigorous than Grokking Deep Learning and includes a lot of fun, interactive visualizations to play with.<br>
3. <b>Inside Deep Learning by Edward Raff</b> is an excellent intermediate book that covers much of the mathematical background, in-depth looks at modern neural network architectures, and develops a good intuition.<br>
4. <b>The Deep Learning Textbook from Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville.</b> Often simply called "the Deep Learning book", it is a rigorous treatment of the mathematics and theory behind deep learning, in addition to covering a number of important practical issues.<br>
5. <b>Deep Learning Architectures by Ovidiu Calin</b> is by far the most theoretical book on this list, and the most challenging in terms of mathematical prerequisites. However, if you want to conduct groundbreaking research in neural networks, this book is an excellent reference to have on hand.
